## Processor
- make each processor send data to next via a small buffer in front - so input buffer doesn't have to wait for EVERYONE

## Input Buffer
Match the actual memory format

## Controller
Fix memory unit parameter values.

Have to handle how multiple sub-units may need to read from the memory at the same time / close to the same time?

## Memory sample:
could have multiple ports for reading/writing for this case?
